# Android NDK Passing Complex Data
[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

## Introduction
The Android NDK Passing Complex Data project provides a demonstration of passing complex data structures between Java and C/C++ using the Android NDK (Native Development Kit). The project showcases how to exchange data between the Java layer and the native layer, enabling efficient and seamless communication.

## Features
- Demonstrates how to pass arrays and structures between Java and C/C++
- Shows how to modify data in the native layer and return it to Java
- Provides a clean and simple codebase for learning and experimentation

## Requirements
- Android Studio 4.0 or later
- Android NDK
- Android device or emulator running Android 5.0 (API level 21) or later

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pgsamila/AndroidNDK-passing-complex-data.git
   ```
2. Open the project in Android Studio.
3. Install the Android NDK and configure its path in the project settings.

## Usage
1. Connect your Android device or start an emulator.
2. Build and run the application from Android Studio.
3. The application displays a simple user interface with a "Pass Data" button.
4. Tap the "Pass Data" button to pass an array from Java to C/C++, perform a calculation on it in the native layer, and return the modified data back to Java.
5. The modified data is displayed on the screen.

Feel free to explore the code to understand the data passing mechanisms and modify it according to your requirements.
